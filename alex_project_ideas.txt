#PROJECT IDEAS
To get the best grade I think we should think outside the box. Alongside the
usual stuff we are going to do I propose the following. We have 27 users each
with varying amounts of activity recorded (in the range of 3000-20,000).
I propose that for each user we try to learn an individual model to predict
their mood for the following day. I would of course happily do this and I think
it will really add something extra to our report.

Rough outline of process:

1. Generally pre-process the data; remove columns, drop null values, scale
inputs etc.
2. Build model: I will look at RNNs for this given that it is a time series. I
will have to reshape the data somewhat to do this, but it shouldn't be too
much hassle.
3. Use some "good" hyper-parameters generally accepted in literature to train
the models for each user. Obviously we will not be able to fully optimise the
model architecture and so on given the time constraints but I am sure that if
we explain this in the report it will be fine.
4. Test the models! I will do a quick proof of concept for my idea and see if
it works at all. If it works then we have a nice addition to our project!
